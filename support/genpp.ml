(** {1:conventions Conventions}

    To find the name of an OCaml function corresponding to a C
    function name, map the [gl] prefix to the module name 
    {!%s.%s},
    add an underscore between each minuscule and majuscule and lower
    case the result. For example [glGetError] maps to
    {!%s.%s.get_error}

    To find the name of an OCaml value corresponding to a C enumerant name,
    map the [GL_] prefix to the module name {!%s.%s} 
    and lower case the rest. For example [GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT] maps to 
    {!%s.%s.color_buffer_bit}. 

    The following exceptions occur:
    {ul
    {- A few enumerant names do clash with functions name. In that case we 
       postfix the enumerant name with [_enum]. For example we have 
       {!%s.%s.viewport} and {!%s.%s.viewport_enum}.}
    {- If applying the above procedures results in an identifier that 
       doesn't start with a letter, prefix the identifier with a ['_'].} 
    {- If applying the above procedures results in an identifier that 
       is an OCaml keyword, suffix the identifier with a ['_'].}} *)
